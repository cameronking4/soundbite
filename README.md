# Soundbite
Native iOS (Swift) project made for extracting and editing audio from videos saved in camera roll in order to dub them / lipsync and share to friends in chat through an iMessage extension. 

Essentially the iMessage extension for Dubsmash. 

#How it Works
	
1. Click on the “Create Audio” button. This will open your camera roll videos folder. 
2. Select the video from which you would like to strip the audio
3. Edit the audio – select the pencil icon, drag the bars to the endpoints of desired sound clip, and press the scissors icon to crop.

4. Launch the Soundbite iMessage extension within a conversation in the “Messages” app bar above the kepad; it can be found in the bar of applications beneath the text message box. This will launch a library database of all your saved sounds.

5. Select a saved sound you would like to use by hitting the checkmark icon next to the audio file.
6. Hit the record button when ready… this will start a video recording, while the selected sound clip starts to play. Once the recording is finished, you can retake, exit, or send.
